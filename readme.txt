Let customers send product enquiries through a popup form, WhatsApp, or SMS without adding products to the cart.

== Description ==

Quick Product Enquiry for WooCommerce lets customers contact your store using an enquiry form, WhatsApp, or SMS directly from your WooCommerce store. Customers can ask questions about products before purchasing, helping you provide faster customer support.

The plugin displays a convenient popup with the contact options you enable. Customers can submit an enquiry, open WhatsApp with a pre-filled message, or open their device's default SMS application to contact your store.

You can configure multiple WhatsApp contact numbers and SMS recipient numbers so customers can choose the appropriate contact.

= Main Capabilities =

* Product enquiry form in a popup
* WhatsApp contact with multiple configurable recipient numbers
* SMS contact with configurable recipient numbers
* Enquiries saved in your WordPress database
* General enquiries not tied to a specific product
* Different headings for in-stock, out-of-stock, and backorder products
* Country code selector with phone number field
* Optional newsletter subscription checkbox
* Name and email pre-filled for logged-in users
* Customisable tab names, headings, and button text
* Enquiry notifications sent to the configured admin email
* Lightweight and easy to configure

= Use Case =

A customer is viewing a product and has a question about its size, availability, or delivery. Instead of adding the product to the cart or searching for a contact page, the customer clicks the enquiry button and chooses how to contact your store: submit an enquiry form, open WhatsApp, or send an SMS using their device's messaging application.

== Features ==

= Enquiry Form =

Customers can submit their name, email address, phone number, and message through the popup form. The product being viewed is automatically associated with the enquiry when applicable.

= Enquiry Records =

Submitted enquiries are saved in your WordPress database so administrators can review them from the plugin's admin interface.

= WhatsApp Contact =

Configure multiple WhatsApp contact numbers, each with its own receiver name. Customers can choose a contact, and WhatsApp opens with a pre-filled message containing relevant product information.

Customers can review and send the message through WhatsApp.

= SMS Contact =

Configure one or more SMS recipient numbers in the plugin settings. Customers can choose a recipient and open their device's default SMS application with a pre-filled enquiry message, where supported by their device and browser.

The customer reviews and sends the SMS using their messaging application. The plugin does not require Twilio or another third-party SMS gateway for this click-to-SMS functionality.

Mobile device, browser, and operating system support may affect how SMS links are handled.

= Stock-Aware Headings =

Configure separate enquiry headings for in-stock, out-of-stock, and backorder products. Use the `{title}` placeholder to include the product name.

= Tab Control =

Enable or disable the Enquiry Form, WhatsApp, and SMS tabs independently. You can also customise the tab labels and button text.

= Translation Ready =

All plugin text uses the `quick-product-enquiry-for-woocommerce` text domain.

== External Services ==

= WhatsApp (Click to Chat) =

When a customer selects a WhatsApp contact, the plugin opens WhatsApp using a click-to-chat link at `https://wa.me`. The link can include a pre-filled message containing enquiry or product information.

The plugin does not send the WhatsApp message automatically. The customer must review and send the message through WhatsApp.

Data shared with WhatsApp may include the selected recipient's phone number and the message content prepared for the enquiry. This data is shared when the customer opens and uses WhatsApp.

WhatsApp is only used when the customer chooses the WhatsApp contact option.

= SMS (Device Messaging Application) =

The SMS contact option uses the customer's device to open a messaging application with a recipient number and a pre-filled message, where supported.

The plugin itself does not send SMS messages through an external SMS gateway. The customer chooses whether to send the message using their messaging application.

SMS delivery, availability, and charges depend on the customer's device, mobile carrier, and messaging service.
